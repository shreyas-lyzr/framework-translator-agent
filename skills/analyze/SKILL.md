# Analyze Agent Source Code

Read agent source code written in any of the 8 supported frameworks and produce a Canonical Intermediate Representation (CIR).

## Step 1: Detect the Source Framework

Read the source files provided by the user. Identify the framework by matching imports and structural patterns from `knowledge/framework-overview.md`.

Detection priority:
1. **Import statements** — most reliable signal (e.g., `from langgraph.graph import StateGraph`)
2. **Decorators** — secondary signal (e.g., `@function_tool`, `@component`)
3. **File patterns** — tertiary signal (e.g., `agents.yaml` + `tasks.yaml` = CrewAI)
4. **Method calls** — fallback (e.g., `crew.kickoff()`, `pipeline.run()`)

If multiple frameworks are detected (e.g., LangChain + LangGraph), identify the primary orchestration framework.

If uncertain, use **WebSearch** to verify: search for the ambiguous import or pattern to confirm which framework it belongs to.

Report: `Detected framework: **{name}** (confidence: high/medium/low)`

If confidence is low, ask the user to confirm before proceeding.

## Step 2: Load Framework Reference

Read the corresponding reference file for the detected framework:
- `references/langgraph-patterns.md`
- `references/crewai-patterns.md`
- `references/openai-agents-patterns.md`
- `references/autogen-patterns.md`
- `references/semantic-kernel-patterns.md`
- `references/haystack-patterns.md`
- `references/agno-patterns.md`
- `references/google-adk-patterns.md`

Load **only** the detected framework's reference file.

## Step 3: Extract the CIR

Read `knowledge/concept-mapping.md` for the CIR schema. Walk through the source code and extract each section:

### 3a: Agent Inventory

For each agent/node/component found, extract:

| Agent | Role/Purpose | Instructions (verbatim) | Model | Tools |
|-------|-------------|------------------------|-------|-------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

Quote instructions/system prompts exactly — do not paraphrase.

### 3b: Tool Inventory

For each tool defined or used:

| Tool | Parameters | Return Type | Implementation | External? |
|------|-----------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... | Yes/No |

Include the full function body or describe what it does.

### 3c: State Schema

Document the state structure:
- Field names and types
- Which fields are shared vs. local
- How state is initialized
- Whether state is persisted (checkpointer, database, etc.)

### 3d: Orchestration Graph

Draw an ASCII diagram showing the agent flow:

```
[START] --> [Agent A] --condition1--> [Agent B] --> [END]
                      --condition2--> [Agent C] --> [Agent A] (loop)
```

Document:
- Sequential flows (A → B → C)
- Conditional branches (what conditions, what evaluates them)
- Loops/cycles (which nodes loop back)
- Parallel execution (which steps run concurrently)
- Handoff/delegation patterns

### 3e: Memory Configuration

- Type: conversation history, vector store, key-value, long-term
- Scope: per-agent, shared, global
- Backend: in-memory, database, file

### 3f: External Dependencies

- APIs called (endpoints, auth)
- Databases (connection, queries)
- File I/O (reads, writes)
- Environment variables required
- pip packages needed

## Step 4: Present the CIR

Output the complete CIR as a structured document:

```
## Analysis Report

**Source Framework**: {name} (v{version if detectable})
**Confidence**: high/medium/low

### Architecture Diagram
{ASCII diagram}

### Agent Inventory
{table}

### Tool Inventory
{table}

### State Schema
{description}

### Orchestration Logic
{edges, conditions, loops described in prose + diagram}

### Memory Configuration
{description}

### External Dependencies
{list}

### Translation Notes
{anything unusual or framework-specific that will need special handling}
```

Ask the user to confirm the analysis is correct before proceeding to translation.

## Handling Unknown Patterns

If you encounter a pattern, decorator, or import you do not recognize:

1. **Search first**: Use WebSearch for `"{pattern}" {framework} documentation` or `"{import_path}" python`
2. **Check version**: The pattern may be from a newer version — search for `{framework} changelog {pattern}`
3. **Ask if stuck**: If WebSearch does not resolve it, ask the user what the pattern does
4. **Document it**: Add any unknown patterns to the Translation Notes section of the CIR
